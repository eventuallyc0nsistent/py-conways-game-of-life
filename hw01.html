<h1 align="center">CS9053 Introduction to Java</h1>
<h2>Homework 1 </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java jdk</a> on your computer. </li>
  <li>Edit, compile and run a Hello World style program on your own computer. (Don't hand this in.)</li>
  <li>Read <a href="http://cis.poly.edu/jsterling/cs9053/java-overview-1.html"><em>The Java Language: An Overview</em></a> </li>
  <li>Read <em>at least</em> the first two chapters in Core Java.</li>
  <li>Implement Conway's game
  of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">life</a>
  in a language<strong> <u>other than Java</u></strong>.  (You can
  find lots of other info on the web.)
    <ul>
      <li>Do not &quot;query the user&quot; for anything. The grader
      does not want to have to type in anything after he starts
      running your program.</li>
      <li>Get the initial state from a file.  Assume the file's name
      is &quot;life.txt&quot; and is in the current working directory.<br>
      No, do not hardcode an absolute pathname!
        <ul>
          <li>The first line of the file will have two integers,
            <ul>
              <li> the first is how many rows there are in the world </li>
              <li> the second is how many  columns there are in the world </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Each row will have spaces and asterisks.
            <ul>
              <li>Spaces represent empty cells</li>
              <li>Asterisks represent occupied cells </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If a row is &quot;short&quot;, then assume the missing
          characters are blank.</li>
          <li>If a row is &quot;long&quot;, then ignore the extra
          characters. </li>
          <li>If there are not enough rows in the file, then assume
          that the missing rows should be filled with empty
          cells. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Display each &quot;generation&quot; of the game to standard
      output (ie. the screen). Generate 10 generations beyond the one
      you read from the file.</li>
      <li>Feel free to use command line parameters, if you like, to
      allow other input files or generation counts to be used. This is
      not required, nor is it extra credit, but you may find it
      convenient while testing.</li>
      <li>The rules of life say:
        <ul>
          <li>A living cell with two or three neighboring living cells
          survives into the next generation.  A living cell with fewer
          than two or more than three living neighbors will die.</li>
          <li> Each empty/dead cell that has exactly three living
          neighbors--no more, no fewer--is a birth cell. It will be
          alive in the next generation. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Suggestion: Create an extra row on the top and bottom as
      well as an extra column to the right and the left of the actual
      data. Mark the extra cells as dead. This will simplify your
      code, as you won't need special checks for &quot;boundary&quot;
      cells. </li>
      <li>Sample <a href="life.txt">input</a>
      and <a href="out.txt">output</a> for the program.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
